            <p>I know your home is far away‚Äî<br />
            different air and different streets‚Äî<br />
            and I can imagine that sometimes you feel like you‚Äôre split between worlds.</p>
      
            <p>And every time I miss you, I remind myself<br />
            that missing you means loving you in motion.<br />
            Loving you with patience. With hope for the future.</p>
      
            <p>So that even when you're not here, you're here.<br />
            In every plan I make with a "someday" attached.<br />
            In the shows I want to watch with you, the songs that sound like us,<br />
            and the life I keep building around the shape of your name.</p>
      
            <p>Your home may be miles away, but a part of it lives here too‚Äî<br />
            tucked in quiet corners, echoed in my laughter,<br />
            waiting in the spaces I‚Äôve saved just for you.</p>
      
            <p>No matter the miles, you‚Äôre never far from where you belong‚Äî<br />
            and that as long as I'm here,<br />
            you will never be alone in your corner of the world.</p>
      
            <p>I hope when the night gets long and quiet over there,<br />
            you can feel that your heart has another home.<br />
            Right here. With me.</p>

        <p>Today is the day the world got lucky.</p>
        <p>The day you arrived ‚Äî full of quiet magic you didn‚Äôt yet know you carried.</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>I think about how many versions of me</p>
        <p>you‚Äôve met along the way ‚Äî</p>
        <p>the sleepy mornings, the worried nights,</p>
        <p>the messy, the silly, the small.</p>
        <p>And how somehow, through all of it,</p>
        <p>you‚Äôve stayed.</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>Bun,</p>
        <p>you are the most gentle truth I know.</p>
        <p>You remind me that love need not be grand gestures ‚Äî</p>
        <p>it‚Äôs how you hold my hand without a word,</p>
        <p>the way you listen when I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm trying to say,</p>
        <p>how you choose softness in a world that often asks for armor.</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>On your birthday,</p>
        <p>I want to tell you this:</p>
        <p>You are not just loved.</p>
        <p>You are <em>treasured</em>.</p>
        <p>The kind of loved that wraps itself around your shoulders</p>
        <p>when you‚Äôre too tired to be strong.</p>
        <p>The kind that believes in your quiet dreams,</p>
        <p>even the ones you whisper only once.</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>You are more than I ever thought I‚Äôd be lucky enough to hold.</p>
        <p>And still ‚Äî here you are.</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>I love you, Bun.</p>
        <p>All of you, exactly as you are,</p>
        <p>in every version,</p>
        <p>today and always.</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>Happy Birthday,</p>
        <p>forever yours,</p>
