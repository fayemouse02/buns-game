            <p>I know your home is far away—<br />
            different air and different streets—<br />
            and I can imagine that sometimes you feel like you’re split between worlds.</p>
      
            <p>And every time I miss you, I remind myself<br />
            that missing you means loving you in motion.<br />
            Loving you with patience. With hope for the future.</p>
      
            <p>So that even when you're not here, you're here.<br />
            In every plan I make with a "someday" attached.<br />
            In the shows I want to watch with you, the songs that sound like us,<br />
            and the life I keep building around the shape of your name.</p>
      
            <p>Your home may be miles away, but a part of it lives here too—<br />
            tucked in quiet corners, echoed in my laughter,<br />
            waiting in the spaces I’ve saved just for you.</p>
      
            <p>No matter the miles, you’re never far from where you belong—<br />
            and that as long as I'm here,<br />
            you will never be alone in your corner of the world.</p>
      
            <p>I hope when the night gets long and quiet over there,<br />
            you can feel that your heart has another home.<br />
            Right here. With me.</p>
